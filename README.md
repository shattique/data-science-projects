# Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects focused on data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning. The projects showcase a range of techniques and workflows used to analyze and derive insights from diverse datasets. These include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics.

## Project Highlights
**Data Analysis**: Detailed exploration of data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.

**Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, such as regression, classification, clustering, and decision trees.

**Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature selection, and feature scaling to prepare datasets for modeling.

**Predictive Analytics**: Training and testing predictive models to make future forecasts or classifications based on historical data.

**Evaluation**: Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance and improve results.
